# Installation

SimpleREST.NET is available as a NuGet package and works and has been tested in >= .NET 6.0

## Using NuGet:

dotnet add package SimpleREST
```

## Or using git

```git
git clone {{repo}}
```

then add the using tags `using SimpleREST` and optionally `using SimpleREST.Extensions` for some nice converter functions
